    "Now a basic remedy for this involves removing a part of the training data and using it to get predictions from the model trained on rest of the data. The error estimation then tells how our model is doing on unseen data or the validation set. This is a simple kind of cross validation technique, also known as the holdout method. Although this method doesnâ€™t take any overhead to compute and is better than traditional validation, it still suffers from issues of high variance. This is because it is not certain which data points will end up in the validation set and the result might be entirely different for different sets."

    "The holdout cross-validation method involves removing a certain portion of the training data and using it as test data. The model is first trained against the training set, then asked to predict output from the testing set. This is the simplest form of cross-validation techniques, and is useful if you have a large amount of data or need to implement validation quickly and easily.\n",

    "Typically the holdout method involves splitting a dataset into 20-30% test data and the rest as training data. These numbers can vary - a larger percentage of test data will make your model more prone to errors as it has less training experience, while a smaller percentage of test data may give your model an unwanted bias towards the training data. This lack of training or bias can lead to Underfitting/Overfitting of our model."
