    "Potential users of LOO for model selection should weigh a few known caveats. When compared with k-fold cross validation, one builds n models from n samples instead of k models, where n>k. Moreover, each is trained on n-1 samples rather than (k-1)n/k. In both ways, assuming k is not too large and k<n, LOO is more computationally expensive than k-fold cross validation.\n",
    "\n",
    "In terms of accuracy, LOO often results in high variance as an estimator for the test error. Intuitively, since n-1 of the n samples are used to build each model, models constructed from folds are virtually identical to each other and to the model built from the entire training set.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, if the learning curve is steep for the training size in question, then 5- or 10- fold cross validation can overestimate the generalization error.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a general rule, most authors, and empirical evidence, suggest that 5- or 10- fold cross validation should be preferred to LOO."
