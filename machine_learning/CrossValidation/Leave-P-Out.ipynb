    "Cross Validation is a very useful technique for assessing the effectiveness of your model, particularly in cases where you need to mitigate overfitting. It is also of use in determining the hyper parameters of your model, in the sense that which parameters will result in lowest test error. This is all the basic you need to get started with cross validation. You can get started with all kinds of validation techniques using Scikit-Learn, that gets you up and running with just a few lines of code in python."
